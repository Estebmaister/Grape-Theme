Java Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to create Spring-based microservices applications. It provides a number of features that simplify the development process, including:

-     Autoconfiguration: Spring Boot can automatically configure many of the dependencies that the application needs, such as a web server and a database.
-     Starters: Spring Boot provides a number of starters, which are pre-configured packages of dependencies that make it easy to add common features to the application, such as web development, security, and data access.
-     Actuator: Spring Boot Actuator provides a number of endpoints that can be used to monitor and manage the application in production.

Spring Boot is a popular choice for developing Java applications because it is easy to use and can help to get the applications up and running quickly and ready for production.

Here are some of the benefits of using Java Spring Boot:
